### Hi there 🦆

My name is João Cruz. I am a Biochemist by degree, but a programmer at heart. I am also secretly a duck.

🥚 Although programming was always in my genes, with my father being a programmer during most of his life, I only discovered my passion and talent for this art recently during a 14-week full stack development bootcamp.

🐣 During the bootcamp I developed my main current skills:
  * Java and Object-Oriented Programming
  * Spring and Express.js for server development
  * MySQL, Hibernate and Node.js MySQL for persistence
  * HTML and CSS for website design
  * DOM manipulation and jQuery for website functionality
  * Deployment using Apache Tomcat and Railway.app

🐥 My main objective right now is to learn C# and to develop a small indie game using Unity.

🦢 Afterwards, the goal is to develop a full stack webapp using ASP.NET and React, before moving on to small cybersecurity and artificial intelligence projects.

🍞 In case you have any tips on how I can tackle these challenges, please let me know!
