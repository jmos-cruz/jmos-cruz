### Hi there :duck:

My name is Jo√£o Cruz. I am a Biochemist by degree, but a programmer at heart. I am also secretly a duck.

Although programming was always in my genes, with my father being a programmer during most of his life, I only discovered my passion and my talent for this art recently during a 14-week full stack development bootcamp.

In this bootcamp, we gained a solid foundation at object-oriented programming with Java and at web development practices by developing projects with MVC architecture. We developed back end solutions with the Spring framework, persisted data with MySQL databases, and created functional front-end views with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

During the 24-hour Hackathon of this bootcamp, me and my team developed the "Estou Al√©m" project (see 'estou-alem' repository below), which implemented a complete full stack solution. Express.js was used to develop the server, a framework that we learned during those 24 hours just for this project. Front end functionality was done with DOM manipulation. Architecture used was MVC and we did all this in less than 22 hours using the Scrum methodology.

Right after the bootcamp ended, we published the Hackathon project using Railway and I developed a small Google Calendar like project which implemented Express.js, for resource routing, the Node.js MySQL driver, for database integration on the server side, and jQuery on the client side to make it a single page application.

My main objective right now is to learn C# and to develop a small indie game using Unity. Afterwards, the goal is to develop a full stack webapp using ASP.NET and React, before moving on to small cybersecurity and artificial intelligence projects.

In case you have any tips on how I can tackle these challenges, please let me know!
